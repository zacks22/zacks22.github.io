        <p>
            I teach all ages ranging from complete beginner to advanced working with students to develop and achieve their unique goals. I have experience preparing for RCM exams, music festival and recital performances, and auditions for honor bands and orchestras. I have experience teaching private lessons, sectionals, and workshops at various summer camps and programs. I have worked at International Music Camp, Vernon Cadet Training Centre Music Program, and with various high school and elementary bands.
