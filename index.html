            Zachary Senick (Захар Сенюк), originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, began his studies at age 16 with 
            Marie Sellar. In 2019, he completed his BMus in Orchestral Performance at McGill University under 
            Stéphane Lévesque. Then in 2021, Senick completed a MMus in Instrumental Performance at the 
            University of Toronto under Eric Hall. He has been a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada and 
            a substitute with the Windsor Symphony Orchestra. Currently, Senick studies with Eric Hall, pursuing a 
            Doctor of Musical Arts in Performance at the University of Toronto, researching works for bassoon by 
            Ukrainian composers during the twentieth century. In addition to performing, he has been a music 
            instructor at the Vernon Cadet Training Centre's summer program for 2018-2019, and a music librarian 
            at the International Music Camp in 2017.  This summer he is looking forward to performing with Orchestre 
            de la Francophonie in Montréal. In his free time, Senick is an avid cook, and his favorite things to make 
            are вареники (varenyky/perogies) and борщ (borsch).
