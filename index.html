            <span class="about-title">Zachary Senick (Захар Сенюк) </span>, originally from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, began his studies at age 16 with Marie Sellar. In 2019, he completed his BMus in Orchestral Performance at McGill University under Stéphane Lévesque. Then in 2021, Senick completed a MMus in Instrumental Performance at the University of Toronto under Eric Hall. He has been a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, Orchestre de la Francophonie and a substitute with the Canadian Opera Company, Windsor Symphony Orchestra, and Ontario Philharmonic. He has given the world premiere of works by Ukrainian composers Alexander Jacobchuk, Dmytro Kyryliv, and Sergei Pilyutikov. In 2022, he was awarded the Hnatyshyn Foundation's Ukraine Heritage-Spirit and Future grant and performed for the Governor General of Canada at Rideau Hall in June 2023. Currently, he is pursuing a Doctor of Musical Arts in Performance at the University of Toronto, researching solo and chamber works for bassoon by Ukrainian composers. In addition to performing, he has been a music instructor at the Vernon Cadet Training Centre's summer program for 2018-2019, and a music librarian at the International Music Camp in 2017. In his free time, Senick is an avid cook, and his favorite things to make are вареники (varenyky/perogies) and борщ (borsch).
